PROBLEM: RUNNING LED

You have 8 LEDs (bits 0–7) stored in a variable leds.

TASKS:
1. Turn ON LEDs one at a time from LED0 → LED7 using a loop
2. After turning ON each LED, print the binary value of leds
3. After the loop, turn OFF all LEDs
4. Bonus: Try doing it using bit shifting instead of individual masks

RULES / TIPS:
1. Use << to move a 1 across bits
2. You can use leds |= ... to turn ON a LED
3. You can reset leds = 0 to turn all LEDs OFF
4. Use bin(leds) to print the LED pattern
