PROBLEM: LED CONTROLLER

You have 8 LEDs, each represented by a bit in the variable leds:

TASKS:
1. Turn ON LED0, LED3, and LED7
2. Check if LED5 is ON, and print "LED5 is ON" or "LED5 is OFF"
3. Toggle LED3 (ON → OFF or OFF → ON)
4. Print the final binary value of leds

RULES / TIPS:
1. Use only bitwise operators (|, &, ^, ~, <<)
2. Don’t use decimal numbers directly
3. Think of each LED as a switch
